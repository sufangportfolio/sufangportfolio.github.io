<h2>Diagnostic, Ongoing formative and summative assessment</h2>

<h3>Diagnostic assessment</h3>

<p>I use Backwards Design when planning any diagnostic assessment. It is important to clarify and understand the essential knowledge, skills and understandings students should be able to gain as the result of a unit of study. The purpose of diagnostic assessment is to find out students’ readiness, interests and learning profile. The latter two are closely related to students’ motivation to learn and efficiency of learning. Some of the diagnostic assessment tools I use to probe students’ understanding include:</p>

<h3>For readiness:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>KWL</li>
    <li>Mindmap</li>
    <li>Hand signal</li>
    <li>Quick quizzes, e.g. Kahoot</li>
    <li>Diagnostic tasks</li>
    <li>Checklists and discussions</li>
    <li>Standard tests (running records, Words Their Way test, Maths Online Interview, Essential Assessment, PAT maths and comprehension test)</li>
</ul>

<h3>For interests:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Daily conversation with students</li>
    <li>Parent-Teacher Interview</li>
    <li>Book choices</li>
    <li>Survey</li>
</ul>

<h3>For learning profile:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Anecdotal notes</li>
    <li>Classroom observation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ongoing formative assessment</h3>

<p>Students are not only the contributor to the assessment but also actively engage in making sense of assessment information, relating what they see to clearly defined learning goals and using feedback to monitor their own learning so they can make adjustment necessary to grow their knowledge, understanding and skill. Some of the formative assessment tools I have used include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Observations and anecdotal notes</li>
    <li>Self-assessment</li>
    <li>Peer-assessment</li>
    <li>Circle time with sharing cards</li>
    <li>Conferencing</li>
    <li>Small group discussion</li>
    <li>Reflective journal</li>
    <li>Graphic organizers</li>
    <li>Badge system</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summative assessment</h3>

<p>Summative assessment tasks mirror the learning goals. The content of the assessment should also reflect the relative importance of each learning goal. The format is aligned with the cognitive level of the learning goal. It should not require students to have specialized knowledge, understanding, skill or resources beyond what is targeted by the learning goals and is taught or available in class. Some of the summative assessment tools I have used include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Paper and pencil closed tasks</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Quizzes</li>
        <li>Problem solving tasks</li>
        <li>Online tests</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Performance-oriented</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Performance tasks (oral presentation, role-play, debate)</li>
        <li>Constructed responses (concept map, flow charts, graphic organizer)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
