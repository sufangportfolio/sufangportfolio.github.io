<h2>Use social and emotional learning programs</h2>

<p>I teach social and emotional skills both explicitly and in a way that is blended into daily subject teaching. Through strategies such as social stories, role-play, and social skills programs, students learn the skills to identify their own emotions and develop healthy relationships with others. Examples of these skills are how to regulate emotions, negotiate, take turns and be a good winner and how to learn cooperatively. Some of the programs I took part in are: CAREA, Mind Matter, Stop-Think-Do, Life Education. </p>

<h2>Use inclusive pedagogies</h2>

<p>I use differentiation and cooperative learning in my classroom. These pedagogies recognise and cater to student diversity, providing rich opportunities for them to engage with others and practice the social and communication skills they have learned. (E.g. 10 is a crab, 1 is a snail lesson)</p>

<h2>Connect it with curriculum content and encourage student engagement</h2>

<p>As time allocated to social learning is often limited, it is important to find other opportunities to reinforce social skills and create a sense of community during subject learning. (E.g. triangle lesson)</p>
 
<h2>Use positive behaviour management</h2>

<p>Besides teaching these students the necessary skills, I analyse the causes behind challenging behaviours and use preventative measures to address these needs before behaviours escalate (e.g. Fawner IBP, NB restorative practice)</p>

<h2>Use Tribes</h2>

<p>Tribes activities were used to engage students both socially and academically (e.g. circle at the beginning and the end of the day, after a lesson)</p>
