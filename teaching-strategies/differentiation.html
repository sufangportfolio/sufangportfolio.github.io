<h2>Differentiation</h2>

<p>Differentiation is how teachers address students’ needs. The role of the teacher in a differentiated classroom is organizers of learning opportunities. They are coaches or mentors who give students as much responsibility for learning as they can handle. No practice is best practice unless it works for the individual learners.</p>

<p>What can be differentiated includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learning environment</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Everyone feels welcomed</li>
            <li>Mutual respect is nonnegotiable</li>
            <li>Students feel safe</li>
            <li>Expectation of growth</li>
            <li>Flexible grouping and sitting</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Content/Process/Product</li>
    <li>Student readiness/interest/learning profile (group orientation/cognitive style/learning environment/cultural preference)</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Words Their Way</li>
    <li>CAFE conferencing</li>
    <li>Writer’s Workshop</li>
    <li>Investigation</li>
    <li>Inquiry projects</li>
    <li>Flexible/Strategy Grouping</li>
</ul>
